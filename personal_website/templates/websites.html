            I’m actively learning modern web development and building clean, responsive websites
            for myself and for small businesses. Below are live examples of my work that show how
            I combine design, usability, and code into real, usable sites.

    <!-- ✅ AUSTIN PAULLEY PORTFOLIO -->
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Austin Paulley Portfolio</h2>

        <!-- ✅ Difficulty Badge -->
        <div class="project-meta">

        <p>
            This website is my personal portfolio, built with Flask and a custom UI theme.
            It integrates with the GitHub API to pull live repositories, showcases my AI
            phishing research project, and hosts writeups and academic papers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I use this site as a sandbox to practice full-stack development, experiment with
            animations like the Vanta.js background, and iterate on UX decisions that make
            it easier for recruiters, professors, and potential clients to understand what I do.

            A small-business website for a German Shepherd breeder, focused on clear branding,
            kennel presentation, and upcoming litter promotion. The layout is designed to make
            it easy for potential buyers to quickly see dogs, learn about the kennel, and find
            contact information.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project helped me practice turning real client needs into a structured layout:
            hero sections, about content, litter info, photo areas, and contact calls-to-action.
            It also reinforced responsive design so the site stays usable on phones and tablets
            where most visitors browse.
